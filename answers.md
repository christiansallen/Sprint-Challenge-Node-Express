- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

  1. Allows us to build RESTful APIs in json format.
  2. serves single page applications

- [ ] Describe Middleware?
      It's the software that allows web apps to communicate with databases or other information on our operating systems.

      everything is a resource in a RESTful API. We can access resources through unique URLs.

- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
      It can send a res.status with a successful result (200, 201, etc.)

- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
      By creating express routers
